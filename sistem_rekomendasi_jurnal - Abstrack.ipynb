            "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. There are many subtypes of breast cancer, which can be identified through the process of molecular and genetic profiling. While the current standard of care utilizes tumor tissue biopsy to subclassify breast cancer, plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) can be detected through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of plasma obtained from a simple blood draw. Tissue biopsy is not only more invasive but because tumors exhibit heterogeneity it can be less accurate. Blood collects DNA shed from normal and cancerous cells alike, thus ddPCR of plasma offers a broader picture of a cancer's genetic makeup. This chapter summarizes how patients with breast cancer can be screened for specific cancerous mutations in both tissue and plasma through the use of ddPCR. Every year, over 230,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and nearly 40,000 die from the disease. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer\u0002related death [1, 2]. Typically, breast cancer is detected via mammography and con\u0002firmed through tissue sampling. From here, patients undergo spe\u0002cific therapies targeted toward their class of breast cancer, which is defined principally by the presence or absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). Researchers have shown that within these subgroups, there are specific, idiosyncratic mutations, which can be useful for assessing burden of disease, predicting response to therapy, and monitoring the latter in a rapid and minimally invasive approach. These include mutations in PIK3CA, ESR1, TP53, MAP3K1, GATA3, RPTOR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 [3â€“6]. Current studies of receptor mutations, however, face a signifi\u0002cant barrier: they rely on single site biopsy of tumor tissue. This method is problematic because tumors have been shown to exhibit heterogeneity, so sampling a single piece of tissue may miss sites of the specific mutations listed above. This same heterogeneity can exist within metastatic tumors, and furthermore, there has been documented heterogeneity between metastases at different sites of the body, even if the metastases originated from the same primary tumor [7, 8]. In other words, tissue biopsy limits clinicians from seeing the whole genetic picture. In order to circumvent this challenge, researchers can now use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on samples of plasma to screen for these same mutations, through a procedure colloquially termed â€œliquid biopsy.â€ The bodyâ€™s blood supply feeds primary tumors as well as metastases, and preliminary research suggests there is no selectivity in terms of which tumor cellsâ€™ DNA is deposited into the blood. In fact, normal and cancerous cells deposit into circulation, which makes the bloodstream an effective repository of cellular DNA, cancer and otherwise [9â€“11]. Thus, circulating blood con\u0002tains traces of all variations of tumor DNA, which makes plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) most representative of the varied genetic makeup of cancer cells. Sampling peripheral blood is also much easier than tissue biopsy, and the procedure comes with far fewer risks. There are many burgeoning applications of ddPCR within oncology, and breast cancer is poised to greatly benefit from the approach. The efficacy of ptDNA/ddPCR for detecting PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer has already been demonstrated with 93.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity in a study of 29 patients with early stage breast cancer [12]. It is important to clarify that this approach is specific for plasma, not serum. Research has shown the latter to not be reliable, whereas plasma has reproducible data supporting its efficacy [13, 14]. From identifying specific mutations sensitive to targeted therapy, to monitoring response to treatment, to detecting residual disease, this highly sensitive, cost effective approach offers improvement of breast cancer treatment and for\u0002ward progress in studying the science behind it. This protocol describes the methodology for using ddPCR to detect tumor DNA in both plasma and primary tumor tissue. \n",

        "search(\"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. There are many subtypes of breast cancer, which can be identified through the process of molecular and genetic profiling. While the current standard of care utilizes tumor tissue biopsy to subclassify breast cancer, plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) can be detected through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of plasma obtained from a simple blood draw. Tissue biopsy is not only more invasive but because tumors exhibit heterogeneity it can be less accurate. Blood collects DNA shed from normal and cancerous cells alike, thus ddPCR of plasma offers a broader picture of a cancer's genetic makeup. This chapter summarizes how patients with breast cancer can be screened for specific cancerous mutations in both tissue and plasma through the use of ddPCR. Every year, over 230,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and nearly 40,000 die from the disease. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer\u0002related death [1, 2]. Typically, breast cancer is detected via mammography and con\u0002firmed through tissue sampling. From here, patients undergo spe\u0002cific therapies targeted toward their class of breast cancer, which is defined principally by the presence or absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). Researchers have shown that within these subgroups, there are specific, idiosyncratic mutations, which can be useful for assessing burden of disease, predicting response to therapy, and monitoring the latter in a rapid and minimally invasive approach. These include mutations in PIK3CA, ESR1, TP53, MAP3K1, GATA3, RPTOR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 [3â€“6]. Current studies of receptor mutations, however, face a signifi\u0002cant barrier: they rely on single site biopsy of tumor tissue. This method is problematic because tumors have been shown to exhibit heterogeneity, so sampling a single piece of tissue may miss sites of the specific mutations listed above. This same heterogeneity can exist within metastatic tumors, and furthermore, there has been documented heterogeneity between metastases at different sites of the body, even if the metastases originated from the same primary tumor [7, 8]. In other words, tissue biopsy limits clinicians from seeing the whole genetic picture. In order to circumvent this challenge, researchers can now use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on samples of plasma to screen for these same mutations, through a procedure colloquially termed â€œliquid biopsy.â€ The bodyâ€™s blood supply feeds primary tumors as well as metastases, and preliminary research suggests there is no selectivity in terms of which tumor cellsâ€™ DNA is deposited into the blood. In fact, normal and cancerous cells deposit into circulation, which makes the bloodstream an effective repository of cellular DNA, cancer and otherwise [9â€“11]. Thus, circulating blood con\u0002tains traces of all variations of tumor DNA, which makes plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) most representative of the varied genetic makeup of cancer cells. Sampling peripheral blood is also much easier than tissue biopsy, and the procedure comes with far fewer risks. There are many burgeoning applications of ddPCR within oncology, and breast cancer is poised to greatly benefit from the approach. The efficacy of ptDNA/ddPCR for detecting PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer has already been demonstrated with 93.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity in a study of 29 patients with early stage breast cancer [12]. It is important to clarify that this approach is specific for plasma, not serum. Research has shown the latter to not be reliable, whereas plasma has reproducible data supporting its efficacy [13, 14]. From identifying specific mutations sensitive to targeted therapy, to monitoring response to treatment, to detecting residual disease, this highly sensitive, cost effective approach offers improvement of breast cancer treatment and for\u0002ward progress in studying the science behind it. This protocol describes the methodology for using ddPCR to detect tumor DNA in both plasma and primary tumor tissue. \")\n",
